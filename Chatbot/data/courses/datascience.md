Evaluation
All the courses except seminar, project work and internship should have internal weightage of
40% and external weightage of 60%. A student should secure minimum of 40% in each category
to pass a course. Final examination will be conducted at the end of each semester for each course
except seminar, project work and internship. The weightage of this final examination is 60% of
the overall weightage. The final grade and grade point in each course will be the sum of overall
weightage of in all categories.
For the courses having laboratory work, 50% of the overall internal weightage is assigned
for practical examination. The school may invite a subject expert for the evaluation of practical
examination.
Seminar, project work and internship are evaluated by different evaluators. To pass these
courses, students should secure at least 40% marks in the evaluation of each evaluator and the
final grade and grade point will be the sum of all the evaluations. For the evaluation of final
presentation, an external examiner will be assigned.
