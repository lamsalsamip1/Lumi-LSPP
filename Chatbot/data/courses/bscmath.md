Job Prospects:
If there is one ﬁeld where career prospects are abundant because the demand exceeds supply, it is Actuarial Science. The course is globally recognized with mutual exemptions with a lot of other international actuarial institutes.

Traditionally, actuaries were found only in the life-insurance sector. However, with the opening up of the economy they are wanted by general insurance, health insurance, reinsurance companies, pensions and employee beneﬁts, investment consultancies, risk management, banks, stock exchanges, private and government agencies. This is one ﬁeld where career prospects are abundant because the demand exceeds supply even in the world.
