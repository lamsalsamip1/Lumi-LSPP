Information on Bachelor of Software Engineering (PU) course

Bachelors of Software Engineering program is a 4-year (8 semesters) 133 credit undergraduate engineering program.  Graduates of this program possess knowledge and skills of a defined engineering approach to complex systems analysis, planning, design and construction. The program has a unique, project-driven curriculum, establishing a new model of communication, teamwork, critical thinking and professionalism.

Software engineering is a young, challenging discipline that is still evolving as information technologies continue to open up new areas of exploration and potential. Engineers mix the theory and practice of computer science, engineering and traditional IT disciplines to create software that is reliable and works efficiently on real machines.

BE Software Engineering course explores the design, construction and engineering of large, complex software systems that meet information processing challenges within constraints such as cost, time and risk management.
