Information on BE in Computer Engineering (KU) course

BE Computer Engineering is a four years, 8 semester program of Kathmandu University. Computer Engineering Students study the design of digital hardware systems, including computers, communication systems and devices that contain Computers. They also study software development with a focus on the softwares used within and between digital devices.

The curriculum of BE Computer Engineering focuses on the theories, principles and practices of relevant areas of traditional electrical engineering and mathematics, and applies them to the problem of designing computers and the many kind of computer-based devices.



College offering BE in Computer Engineering (KU) course: Kathmandu University School of Engineering

Job Prospects:
If you major in Computer Engineering, you'll learn all about the hardware and software aspects of computer science. You'll gain a solid understanding of circuit theory and electronic circuits, too. Also, because Computer Engineering is closely linked with Electrical Engineering, the fields are found in the same department at many universities. Consequently, many undergraduate programs incorporate most of the core curricula in both electrical engineering and computer science so graduates will be prepared to work in either field.Computer Engineering is a difficult major but it's a major that's in demand. Software engineering companies, telecommunications firms, designers of digital hardware, and many other business enterprises hire Computer Engineering majors right out of college and pay them well.
