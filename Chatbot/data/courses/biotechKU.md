Information on B.Tech. (in Biotechnology) (KU) course

B.Tech. (in Biotechnology) is a pioneering program in Nepal. Biotechnology is a frontier area offering a new technological base to understand living beings at the molecular level unravel the genetic codes that govern biological processes and thereby be able to manipulate those for the betterment of humankind.

Biotechnology is not just one subject; rather it is an amalgam of a number of different scientific fields. Biotechnology uses knowledge of microbiology, molecular biology, immunology, biochemistry just to name a few. In recent times, new concepts such as bioinformatics, proteomics, microarrays are becoming standard terminologies within this vast area of research. Novel research findings by scientists in this field of science are helping people worldwide in their quest for a healthier lifestyle.

Colleges that offer  B.Tech. (in Biotechnology) (KU) course:
1. Kathmandu University School of Science




Job Prospects:
A career in biotechnology is not just a job; it is an invitation to participate in the development of new products and processes that also contribute to improving people's standards of living.

Major avenues of career development opportunities are as follows:

1. Research and development in the processing of diverse biological materials and in the field of managing bio-industries.
2. Employment opportunities are available in the industries such as chemicals, pharmaceuticals, food and beverages and plant and animal biotechnology and other options in forensics, disease and diagnostic therapy, education and environmental protection bodies.
3. Opening ways for pursuing further studies at Masters or Doctoral levels.

Eligibility:
10+2 (or equivalent) examinations with minimum of 50% marks in aggregate and 50% in Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics (PCM) or Physics, Mathematics and Computer Science (PMCs). 

OR 

Minimum 2.4 GPA in aggregate and minimum C+ in Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics (PCM)  or Physics, Mathematics and Computer Science (PMCs) and minimum C in other subjects. 

Formal Admission takes place in July - August for the Fall Term. Selection of candidates is based on:

Scores on the KU Undergraduate Admission Test (a two-hour test to access proficiency in Physics, Chemistry, Biology and Mathematics), and
1. Merit of academic attainments up to the higher secondary or intermediate level
2. Personal interview

Note: 
Students who have completed +2 in Biology stream must have taken additional mathematics course and passed it with cumulative PCM of 50% or 2.4 GPA to be eligible for the indicated programs. 

Admission Criteria:
Candidates are required to appear for Kathmandu University Common Admission Test (KUCAT) and will be offered admission based on rank in KUCAT result in all merit seats and in the quota seats. The admission test will be conducted in the mode of Computer-Based Test (CBT) as described in the KUCAT CBT Information.

Scholarships
Scholarships are available for meritorious and financially weak students as per KU provision. The application for scholarship has to be submitted after the admission with necessary documents. In each program or subject area, one tuition fee waiving scholarship (2 for program with 60 intake capacity) will be available for the first semester based on KUCAT CBT score. Highest merit based scholarship after first semester will be based on Semester Grade Point Average obtained by students in the class.
