All the courses are based on a continuous assessment system where every week, you will be engaging in class & online discussions, writing papers and doing presentations alongside your course projects.

Eligibility criteria:
Nepali and non-Nepali nationals with a High School degree or equivalent in any discipline are eligible to apply for King’s College BSCS Program. Note: Students must go through the College aptitude test for selection to this program.

Three concentration options are available in the BSCS course:

1. Data Science:
   Students taking the Data Science Concentration will be working with data, plenty of data to turn them into meaningful insights and explanatory visualizations. The program allows students to dig deeper into the various areas and applications under Data Science like Predictive Analytics and Artificial Intelligence (AI), including Machine Learning and Deep Learning models. In addition to the foundational coursework, students pursuing Data Science will take more advanced mathematical and statistical courses to complement their knowledge of modern techniques with that of foundational theory as well. End of the program, you will be ready to take on roles such as Data Engineer, ML Engineer, Data Analyst, and even pursue Data Science-related Graduate courses.

2. Software and Web App Development:
   The Software and Web Application Development Concentration is focused on producing software developers and web artisans through rigorous coursework on system analysis and design, modern web-based application development, secured programming, and emerging trends in software development. Keeping in view the changing landscapes of the industry, you will also be exposed to modern development methodologies for rapid and continuous deployment and delivery such as DevOps and the fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence. You will be graduating with a strong foundation in Computer Science coupled with the technical skills required to be successful in the national as well as international software industry for designing, developing, and implementing successful software projects. Career options include Software Engineer, UI/UX Designer, Web Developer,etc.

3. Artificial Intelligence
   The Concentration in Artificial Intelligence (AI) provides students with the skills and knowledge to explore the exciting world of artificial intelligence to flourish them into the cutting-edge field.This concentration focuses on five distinct courses beyond the core computer science curriculum,allowing students to explore the complexities of AI, machine learning, data engineering, naturallanguage processing, and computer vision. By completing the concentration in AI, students will acquire a comprehensive skill set in AI and its associated technologies, positioning them for promising careers in different fields. This concentration prepares them to be at the forefront of innovation and problem-solving in the AI landscape. Career pathways include AI/Machine Learning Researcher, Computer Vision Engineer, Natural Language Processing (NLP) Engineer, Robotics Engineer, AI Software Developer, AI Ethics Consultant
