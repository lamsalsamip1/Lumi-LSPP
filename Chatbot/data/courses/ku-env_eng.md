Information on BTech Environmental Engineering (KU) course

The BTech in Environmental Engineering at Kathmandu University is a four-year interdisciplinary program launched in 2005. It combines science and engineering to address environmental issues, focusing on pollution mitigation, sustainable technology development, and environmental risk reduction. The program includes practical, project-based training and courses in basic and applied sciences, engineering, and environmental studies. Graduates are equipped for careers in environmental regulation, industries, hydropower, NGOs, and research institutions or for further studies globally.

Colleges that offer BTech Environmental Engineering (KU) course:

1. Kathmandu University School of Science

Venue

The classes are held at the Department of Environmental Science and Engineering, School of Science, Kathmandu University, Dhulikhel. The university is located on a hilltop with 17 hectares of land, 28 km east of the capital. The peaceful environment and panoramic view of Himalayan range are unique site characteristics that are conducive to a healthy atmosphere for learning.
