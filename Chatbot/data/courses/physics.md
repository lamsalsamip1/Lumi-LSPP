Information on BSc Physics course by Tribhuvan University:

B.Sc Physics is a four year annual program of Tribhuvan University. Tribhuvan University started 4 years Bachelor of Science in Physics (B.Sc Physics) from 2012 AD.

Physics is one of the most fundamental of all sciences, and is the basis of our scientific knowledge of the physical world. It seeks to explain the behaviour of matter, time and space in the universe and covers phenomena ranging from subnuclear interactions to cosmological events like the Big Bang. The traditional B.Sc. degree in Physics is centred on understanding scientific fundamentals and it is through this basic approach that advances in scientific knowledge and technological innovations have been made.

Eligibility:
Students who wish to enroll in TU’s BSc. Physics must have completed their 10+2 from the Physical or Biological group in Science with extra Mathematics or equivalent, with a minimum of 50% in aggregate or at least grade C in three subjects in the Advance Level from any Board/University recognized by TU.

Entrance Exam and Application process:

Should the student meet the standard academic cut off for the program, they would have to take an entrance exam to secure their name in the merit list for the program. The first step in doing that is to register for an entrance exam.
The student can go to any TU-affiliated college offering the BSc. Physics program and pick up the entrance exam form or find the form on the official website of Institute of Science and Technology, TU. When they receive the form, they should also inquire about the necessary fees and attachments that are to be submitted along with the form. Once the form is filled out and the necessary attachments are ready, the student should either go to the respective college with the entrance fees in cash or produce a bank deposit voucher of the same amount payable to the college to formally register for the entrance exam and receive an admit card.
On the day of the entrance exam, the students will have to sit down for 2 hours and attempt a hundred multiple-choice answer-style questions. The question layout will have 40 questions from Physics, 40 questions from maths, and 20 questions to validate your English aptitude. To pass this test, the student would have to obtain at least 30 points.That being said, just passing the entrance test does not ensure a seat in the program. The students who pass the exam will be considered for the merit list. The higher that one scores in the exam, the higher they would be ranked on the merit list, and the students with higher ranking on the merit list will be given priority during enrollment. If two students score the same score on the entrance exam, the student with the better academic history will be given priority.
